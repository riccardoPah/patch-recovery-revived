# Patch-Recovery-Revived

The only working `patch-recovery` tool that ever lived to patch Samsung's recovery images to enable **fastbootd mode**. 

## Features

- Supports `.img`, `.lz4`, and `.zip` formats as input.
- Automatically downloads and processes recovery images from a provided URL or local path.
- Hex-patches the recovery binary to enable **fastbootd** mode.
- Signs the patched recovery image with Google's RSA private test key.
- Creates an ODIN-flashable `.tar` file for easy flashing.

## Usage

### 🟢 GitHub Workflow

Use the GitHub Actions workflow to automate the process:

1. Star and fork this repository.
2. Trigger the workflow manually via the **Actions** tab.
3. Provide the required inputs:
   - **Model**: Your device's model number.
   - **Recovery Link**: Direct download link to the recovery image.
   - You can upload the recovery and get a direct link from https://filebin.net/

- The workflow will generate a patched recovery image and upload it as an artifact.
- Optionally uploaded to [GoFile](https://gofile.io/) for easy sharing.

### Output

**The patched recovery image will be available as:**
- A `.tar` file for ODIN flashing.

### 🟢 Local Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ravindu644/patch-recovery-revived.git
   cd patch-recovery-revived
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./patch-recovery.sh <URL/Path to Recovery Image> <Model Number>
   ```

   The script will automatically install all required dependencies and process the recovery image.

### Note

If the tool does not enable fastboot mode for your device, please start an issue on GitHub. Make sure to upload the `recovery.img` file so the issue can be investigated.
