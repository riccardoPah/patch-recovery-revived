## Features

- Supports `.img`, `.lz4`, and `.zip` formats as input.
- Supports both `recovery` and `vendor_boot` images.
- Automatically downloads and processes recovery images from a provided URL or local path.
- Hex-patches the recovery binary to enable **fastbootd** mode.
- Creates an ODIN-flashable `.tar` file for easy flashing.

Notes:

- All the hex patches are located in [this database file](./hex-patches.sh).  
- On Samsung devices, `vendor_boot` contains the recovery ramdisk, only if the device uses the A/B partition scheme.  



---

If this tool didn’t enable the `fastbootd` mode, it means we need to find your exact `hex` byte sequence to enable it. To learn how to get those values, please refer to the guide on the ["how-to-find-patches"](./how-to-find-patches/) page.

2. Trigger the workflow manually via the **Actions** tab.
3. Provide the required inputs:
   - **Model**: Your device's model number.
   - **Recovery Link**: Direct download link to the recovery image.
   - You can upload the recovery and get a direct link from https://filebin.net/

- The workflow will generate a patched recovery image and upload it as an artifact.
- Optionally uploaded to [GoFile](https://gofile.io/) for easy sharing.

### Output

**The patched recovery image will be available as:**
- A `.tar` file for ODIN flashing.
